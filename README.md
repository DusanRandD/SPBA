# SPBA
This algorithm implements software realization of the smallest unit of artificial intelligence written in C language. This single perceptron is able to solves simple logical operations like AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and NOT. Neural network with only one neural cell have two binary inputs and one output. Coefficients that are calculate are two weights and one bias in backpropagation sort of learning process. It is added the logging functionality of all coefficients, over iteration process of learning, into one textual file which can be analyzed later. This algorithm can not resolve XOR or XNOR logical operations.
